 * PROJECT 9: Add username login via cookies and tracking of image by “owner” (the person who uploaded it). Allow the owner to delete it. (5 pts.; app_feature)
 	
 	To run: python server.py -A imageapp
 	
 	To use new functionality:
 		When load you will see that it no more load the image in the system
 		Click in "Upload" tab.
 		Insert a name and save it.
 		The you'll be allowed to upload an image

 		You can run in another browser and save another name and upload another
 		image. Both browser will work separately.
 		
    * PROJECT 22:Make a thumbnail list using server-side resizing on the fly (in Python code, using PIL or some other image manipulation library). The distinguishing feature here should be that large images are not downloaded to the browser and resized there (as would happen if you used image attributes; see #5)
    
        To use: You need to have "pillow" installed in your python
    
        To run: python server.py -A imageapp
        
        To use new functionality:
            Click on "Thumbnails List" tab in the right corner.
            
            Every image that you upload will appear in the "/list_thumbs" page

            I use PIL to resize the image, and base64 to embed it to <img> tag.

    * First Commit hw11
    * PROJECT 23: Write a URL handler so that each image is referred to by its number, e.g. /image_raw/10; make it so that going to the latest image in your imageapp redirects to the right image number. (5 pts; app_feature)

        To use: run the server and access /image_raw/0 or /image_raw/1. Those 2 images are placed in the database when the server
        starts. The users images can be accessed in the same way where the numbers are the user_id in the cookies.
	* PROJECT 14: Write down clear instructions for setting up a new Ubuntu machine on a cloud service of your choice (I have some documentation for Amazon) and installing the imageapp server on port 80. (5 pts; hosting)
		      
		      Check it in the "project14" folder in this directory
